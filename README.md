# Reversed Polish Notation calculator

Test project based on the Reversed Polish Notation calculator mainly to test the following points:
- usage of docker to build both front and back parts of the project
- python unit test performed during container build
- react build performed during container build

Each part of the project (backend/frontend) has its own README.md file

To Build both part of the project:
```
docker compose up -d
```

You can then access the frontend using [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
